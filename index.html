        <h1>Our Reasons Why</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In 2021, Sean was experiencing some difficulties with his Mental Health. While he was proactive with trying to seek support and a diagnosis, 
          he was not aware of the numerous resources available to him to support him on his MH journey.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Sean was a kind lad, always making the time to support others who were struggling with their own issues - in spite of having struggles of his own. 
          It just came naturally to him to want to help others. Sean died on 4th December 2021. He was 17.    
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Unfortunately, Sean never had the chance to access the support that would have made the world of difference to him; largely owing to the fact that 
          the resources he needed were not readily available to him.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We are now Sean's voice. In his name, we will help others access the support they need as well as provide a space for people to open up and talk 
          about what they are going through. This is Sean's legacy.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Our mission is to get the people of Gosport talking about their Mental Health and seeking support where needed.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Our model is simple - #SpeakShareSupport
        </p>

      <div class="Intro">
        <p>
          ðŸ’œ SPEAK - One of the hardest things to do is to accept you need help. There's a misconception that "not feeling normal"
          is something to be ashamed of; that's simply not true. That's why we'll never judge you for having mustered the courage to reach out - 
          if anything, we admire it. There's a huge power in putting your feelings into words, and getting it all out there. When you
          are ready to attend one of our sessions, one of the Team will ask you your name (give a fake one, if you want to) and why you have come 
          along - tell us as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Absolutely NO information you give will be recorded.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          ðŸ’œ SHARE - At our meetings, you'll be given a free cup of tea or coffee (biscuits, too) and introduced to other brave
          people who have decided to take those steps towards a better life. Here, we will facilitate active conversation about anything and everything, 
          with the aim of sharing experiences and helping you see that you're not alone (in fact, 1 in 4 people will experience
          some form of ill mental health in their lives).
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          ðŸ’œ SUPPORT - You will have access to our reference materials throughout the meeting, which one of the Team will support
          you to look through to see if there are any professional services available to you that are relevant to your situation. 
          This will be an ever-evolving part of our offering as we identify what types of Mental Health support is needed in Gosport. Where appropriate,
          one of our team will help you with any practical support needed to help you refer yourself to another service.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          And if you're put off from trying us out because you think you're alone, or nobody could possibly understand what you're going through, 
          think again; ALL of our team have suffered or are currently suffering Mental Health issues. You're in great company.
        </p>

          we will be obliged to inform the Police of any matters of an illegal nature.

          Sean's Safe Space is not a professional organisation, nor are we a registered charity - we are simply a group of local people who want to 
          help others within the Gosport community.)

        <h1>What to Expect</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          When you come along to one of our meetings, you'll be greeted by one of our volunteers who will ask your name and why you've come along. 
          Tell them as much or as little as you are comfortable with. (We don't record your name, or any details about you - it's
          just so we know how to address you!)
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>ðŸ’œ We'll ask you to read through a few "house rules" before you come through - this covers confidentiality, respect
            and what you can and can't discuss at our meetings.</li>
          <br>
          <li>ðŸ’œ We'll sort you with a tea or coffee, and you can help yourself to some biscuits too.</li>
          <br>
          <li>ðŸ’œ Once everyone is settled, a volunteer will lead a "themed, but open, conversation" to help everyone relax into
            the evening.</li>
          <br>
          <li>ðŸ’œ You'll then have an opportunity to chat about what's on your mind; we'll take it in turns and ensure everyone gets
            a chance to talk if they choose to.</li>
          <br>
          <li>ðŸ’œ You'll have access to our reference materials/folders throughout the whole session. Ask one of our volunteers to
            go through these with you if you wish. We'll write down anything relevant for you to take away with you.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
          Come and give us a go! If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email - seanssafespace.gosport@gmail.com - 
          and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

        <h1>Our House Rules</h1>
        <br>
        <p>WELCOME TO SEAN'S SAFE SPACE.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We ask that everyone who enters this space - regardless of their reasons why they're here tonight - adheres to the following:</p>

        <br>

        <p>1. BE RESPECTFUL</p>   
        <br>
        <p>You may hear some things this evening that you disagree with. Please remember, we're all unique and we all have our own perspectives. 
          That doesn't mean that one opinion is right and one is wrong.</p>

        <br>

        <p>2. BE RESPONSIBLE</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed for any reason during tonight's session, please feel free to step out of the room and a 
          member of our Volunteer Team will follow you to make sure you're ok.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In order to maintain a positive atmosphere, anyone arriving at our meetings under the influence of drink or drugs will be asked to 
          leave and come back another time.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>3. BE CONFIDENTIAL</p>
        <br>
        <p>By attending this meeting tonight, you are automatically expected to keep anything and everything you hear to yourself. Confidentiality is KEY.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Please do not discuss any specific details surrounding legal matters. You are more than welcome to explain how a situation is making you feel, but 
          do not disclose any identifiable information regarding any criminal matter. Please ask for clarification if needed.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>4. DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So that everyone gets the chance to talk, we may at times ask you to "wrap up" when you are talking; we genuinely mean no offence, but we're limited 
          on time and it's really important that anyone who wants to has some time to offload.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>5. THERE'S NO PRESSURE</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          While we hope you feel comfortable with opening up, we understand that you may not feel ready. There is ZERO expectation of you; take it at your own pace, 
          and come back again next week if you couldn't "do it" this week.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>6. HAVE FUN!</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's not all doom and gloom! If nothing else, just enjoy the next 75 minutes - what have you lost by trying?</p>

        <h1>Meet the team: Fiona</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, I'm Fiona. As soon as I met Sean's family, I knew I wanted to be involved in this well needed project, 
          as I know how difficult it can be to get the support you need. After struggling with my own mental health throughout my life, 
          I have now managed to find ways of coping and I'm lucky to have a really supportive family - that's my Husband, my rock, in the picture.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I previously worked in childcare and education for over 20 years and my main focus was behavioural/learning difficulties and supporting 
          neurodiversity in young children.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I do voluntary work with various local charities and now Sean's Safe Space too. Over the past few months, I have completed training in 
          Suicide and Self Harm Prevention & Awareness and Adverse Childhood Experiences. I'm currently studying Mental Health in Early Years and 
          also further training in Domestic Violence.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>My aim is to be able to provide useful resources, a listening ear and the support from someone who genuinely understands how challenging 
          it is to struggle with mental health.
        </p>
